## Complete Conversation Summary
The user reported that collaborator "mh seif" displayed inconsistent points across different pages - showing 175 points in some locations but "0 points gagnés" and "0 jours de suite" on the profile page. This indicated a fundamental inconsistency in how user statistics were calculated and displayed.

Through investigation, I discovered the root cause was two different point calculation systems running in parallel. The MesDefis page was calculating points manually using a local algorithm (100 points per confirmed challenge + 25 points for pending participations), while the profile page used a backend API (`/api/users/me/stats`) that summed actual `score` values from the database. This created discrepancies when the database scores were missing or zero.

The core issue was that older confirmed participations in the database had `score = 0` because they were created before the scoring system was fully implemented. While new proof approvals correctly awarded 100 points via the proof.controller.js system, legacy participations remained unscored.

**Solutions Implemented:**

**Backend Changes:**
- Modified `getUserStats` in user.controller.js to automatically update any confirmed participations with score = 0 to score = 100, providing retroactive scoring for legacy data
- Added comprehensive logging to debug the statistics calculation process
- Ensured the existing proof approval system continues to award 100 points for new validations

**Frontend Changes:**
- Refactored MesDefis.jsx to use the centralized `fetchUserStats` API instead of local calculation, ensuring consistency with the profile page
- Modified the point calculation logic to prioritize actual database scores over manual calculations
- Both pages now use the same data source, eliminating discrepancies

**Database Analysis:**
Created a debug script that revealed the database contained 29 users and 22 participations (9 confirmed), with a total of 500 points distributed across users. This confirmed that some participations had proper scores while others were zero.

**Key Technical Approach:**
The solution centered on establishing a single source of truth for user statistics through the backend API, while implementing automatic data migration for legacy records. This ensures both current and future data consistency without requiring manual database fixes.

**Current Status:**
All code changes have been implemented and the backend server restarted. The system should now display consistent points across all pages, automatically fix historical data gaps, and maintain consistency through the centralized API. The debug investigation confirmed the data structure was correct but highlighted the need for the retroactive scoring fix that was implemented.
