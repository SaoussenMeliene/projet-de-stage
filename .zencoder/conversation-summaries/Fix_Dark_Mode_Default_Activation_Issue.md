## Complete Conversation Summary
The user reported that dark mode was automatically activating on login and registration pages even when they hadn't activated dark mode, and wanted the theme toggle icon to work properly (only activating dark mode when clicked, not by default).

The conversation started with me fixing a syntax error in AdminDashboardNew.jsx where there was an unterminated comment `{/* Modal i` at line 3009. This was causing a Vite/React-Babel compilation error. I removed the incomplete comment and added the proper component closing structure, then verified the fix with a successful build.

The main issue was identified in the ThemeContext.jsx file, where the theme was being initialized with dark mode as the default (`useState('dark')`). The useEffect was also forcing dark mode when no saved theme was found in localStorage. I modified the ThemeProvider component to:

1. Change the default state from `useState('dark')` to `useState('light')`
2. Update the initialization logic to detect the user's system preference (`window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches`) instead of forcing dark mode
3. Only use dark mode if it's either explicitly saved in localStorage or if the user's system preference is set to dark mode

The theme toggle functionality was already properly implemented in HeaderDashboard.jsx with a button that calls `toggleTheme()` on click. The pages LoginPagePro.jsx and RegisterPageNew.jsx were correctly using the `useTheme()` hook to apply dark/light styling based on the `isDark` value.

The solution ensures that:
- The application starts in light mode by default (unless system preference is dark or user has previously selected dark mode)
- The toggle icon works correctly to switch between themes
- Theme preferences are properly saved to localStorage
- All existing theme-dependent styling continues to work across login, registration, and other pages
